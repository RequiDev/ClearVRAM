# ClearVRAM

Disclaimer: Build 1106 introduced better memory management for avatars in VRChat. This mod is not techincally  not needed, but if you still experience problems where your RAM/VRAM gets close to 100%, feel free to use the mod.

Adds a button using UIExpansionKit to clear out every model that's not currently used from your RAM and VRAM. Depending on the world and amount of people it can significantly help with RAM/VRAM problems.
